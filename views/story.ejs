<h1>My Story</h1>
<hr>
<div class="container">
  <p>
    In May of 2020, I graduated from Ole Miss with a Psychology/Neuroscience Degree (w/ honors).
  </p>
  <p>
    During my time there, I was heavily invested into Neuroscience research.
  </p>
  <p>
    I worked in a Neuroscience lab as an Undergraduate Research Assistant, I presented at National Conferences, and published an honors thesis on the research I did.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was also during that time that I decided to take a couple of Computer Science Courses.
  </p>
  <p>
    In those courses, I learned the basics of computer programming using Java.
  </p>
  <p>
    The projects I made were really fun! You can see some of them here.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was through those courses that I developed a genuine curiousity about software.
  </p>
  <p>
    After graduation, I took a job at Mizzou as a Medical Research Assistant.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, I still wanted to keep learning and developing software.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though, I mainly wanted to start making software that I could share with my wife (who is a visual person).
  </p>
  <p>
    This led me into exploring the Javascript Ecosystem. I started learning and making projects in HTML/CSS, Javascript, Nodejs, and MongoDB for about a year.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the present day, I still reside in Columbia, MO but my curiosity has led me to exploring the Python Ecosystem.
  </p>
  <p>
    I still have love for Java and Javascript! But these days I am building cool projects like Twitter bots, APIs, Chat Apps, and Web Games using Python, Flask, Django and NoSQL databases.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am currently searching for a Fullstack or Backend role, so if you have or know of an opportunities, please contact me!
